# Flint Fix-Up
A mod for Vintage Story to resolve some issues I have with its early-game.

## Why?
Picture this: You've just gotten through your third day in Vintage Story. You're starting to really get the hang of the crafting system, but you haven't really gotten into the metals yet because you're still working on your food supply.

Night falls, but this time there's motion in the dark. You were smart enough to build a bed, and sleep through the worst of it, but when you wake up...your home is surrounded by Drifters! You ready your spear, which is a bit worn down from hunting, but surely you can take a few Drifters...

...and then your spear snaps after the second Drifter. See, by default, even a Flint Spear has only 32 durability, doing 2 damage per swing--and Drifters have a whopping 12 health! This means that you eat at least 6 durability with each Drifter you kill, and even a brand new flint spear can only kill 5 Drifters before snapping. If you've used half the durability on your spear, you can't even kill three Drifters with it, and Drifters often show up in numbers of at least half a dozen. This has led to many an early-game death for me, which is incredibly frustrating.

The really funny part is, flint weapons *also* have a lower attack tier than copper, meaning that they suffer even more if you're fighting something with armor--but that doesn't excuse their utterly dismal performance against the first enemy you're likely to encounter.

## How does this mod fix it?
Simple: It patches the damage and durability of the stone-tier axes and spears to be roughly equivalent to their copper counterparts. As of right now, regular stone tools have slightly less damage than flint, which in turn is slightly worse than obsidian, which actually has slightly *better* stats than copper. This makes stone-age weapons significantly more viable, especially if you can gain a height advantage of some kind and avoid damage that way, since you can now kill drifters more quickly and kill more with a single spear.

Other flint tools like the knife are unaffected, because they're typically not used for combat anyway. Only the axe and spear are buffed. 

Note that this mod is technically in beta! It's basically untested, so I don't know how these changes affect the game. I may decide to scale back the durability buff, the damage buff, or *both* depending on how I like the changes.

## Wouldn't this make flint weapons OP?
First of all, in case it wasn't obvious: I think flint weapons are severely underpowered. You should not have to eat the entire durability of your first weapon in a signle encounter.

Secondly, the damage tier system means that as soon as you start fighting armored enemies, copper and bronze are much more useful. Remember, the higher the weapon tier relative to the armor tier, the less the armor protects against damage--meaning that improvised and wood-lamellar armors, which are already less effective against stone weapons, are even less effective against copper. Similarly, while leather provides regular protection against stone, it suffers against copper. As far as I can tell, enemies don't really use the armor tier system--but, frankly, by the time you start fighting Locusts, you should have bronze already, and that's a straight upgrade over both copper and flint.

Finally, it's also important to note that you can't make flint pickaxes. There's still a reason to have copper--your first pick may end up being made of copper.
